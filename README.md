Welcome to the **Snake Game Clone** built with **Python** and **Pygame**! 🕹️

## 💡 Tips:

- The snake **wraps around the screen**, so if it goes off one side, it will appear on the opposite side.
- Try to stay focused and avoid moving too fast. It’s easy to get caught in a corner!
- The more food you eat, the longer the snake gets, so plan your moves carefully!
